Problem 1: Plotting experimental data
  Makes a density plot of the data contained in the file stm.txt.
  
Problem 2: The quadratic equation
  Solves for the two routes of the quadratic equation using two differnt equations.
  
  Problem 2c: This program calculates both roots of a quadratic equations in all cases.
  
  Problem 3: Heat capacity of a solid
    Calculate C_V when you input T. 
    Use the trapizodial rule to evaluate the integrand with N=1000 sample points.
    The figure is a graph of heat capacity as a function of temperature from T=5K to T=500K.
    
 Problem 4: Numerical Integral
  Calculate E(x) for values of x from 0 to 3 in steps of 0.1.
  Also, graphs E(x) as a function of x.
